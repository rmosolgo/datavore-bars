54,China,"Loan for Rebuilding Infrastructure (Benguela Railway, Luanda Airport, Luanda to Uíge Highway)",2005,FALSE,"In March/April of 2005, the China International Fund (CIF) and the GRN signed a loan agreement with documents signed in both Hong Kong and Luanda. An initial amount of $2.9 billion US dollars was allocated for the war strewn country and construction projects (taking $2 billion of that money). These projects included reconstructing the Luanda airport and the construction of a new one (US$450 million), expansion and repairs to railway lines such as the Benguela railway line (US$300 million), cleaning the Luanda bay, a new sewage system for the capital, and others. While many of these projects began, in 2007, some had halted due to problems within CIF and the construction company, Beiya International Development Ltd. By the end of 2008, 80 percent of the initial US$2.9 billion disbursement had been spent on these projects. The loan overall was a low interest loan funded with providing Angolan oil. Project list individually:CONFIRMED: China contributed US$300 million in 2006 to begin the refurbishment of the Benguela Railway. Since 2006 sections of the railway have become operational, including the section that runs eastward to Huambo from Lobito, a distance of 423 km. The remainder of the project is expected to be completed in December of 2012. The entire project is expected to cost US$ 1.56 billion, but this funding does not all originate from Chinese sources. China Railway 20 Bureau Group Corp. has been the main contributor to the renovations.CONFIRMED: The new International Luanda Airport, located 30 kilometres from the Angolan capital, is being built by China International Fund Limited. The airport, which will cover an era of 5,000 hectares, will have two double runways. China gave US$ 450 million to the project. Although the project was scheduled to be concluded in 2010, one observer reported in 2011, 'apart from cranes, trucks, Chinese nationals, and a partial foundation, there was little evidence of serious work going on. 'CIF is a company that has no construction record or credentials,' a Chinese official said cynically. 'Largely they are brokers who get contracts from the Angolan government and sell them to other Chinese companies for huge profits.'CONFIRMED: Chinese state company China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), is rebuilding 371 kilometers of the national road linking Kifangondo (Luanda), Caxito (Bengo), Uíge and Negage (Uíge) in Angola. The project, which began in December 2005, is estimated to cost US$211 million. The rebuilding project includes 12 bridges, 10 of which will be new, and requires over 200 aqueducts to be built. The project was expected to be done in June of 2008, but a PPIAF source states that the project was completed on July 25, 2008.CONFIRMED: The new bridge over the River Cunene, in Xangongo, Angola, built by the subsidiary of the China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) is complete as of June 2009. The bridge, estimated to cost US$29 million, is 808 metres long and 11.64 metres wide and was built over two years and five months. The work was audited by Africon Gabenk BKS. The road between Ondjiva and Xangongo, covering 108 kilometers, was also built by CRBC for US$47 million and was completed as of June 2009.CONFIRMED: Around US$100 million dollars of the China credit line will be spent in the rehabilitation and equipping of various health posts in the central Huambo Province announced by Angolan Health minister Sebastiao Veloso in August of 2005. The mentioned sum will be used in the rehabilitation and equipping of the regional hospital, located in Huambo city and in the construction of two district hospitals.STAFF_NOTES:This project could benefit from splitting.","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining",,210,Implementation,2,Loan (excluding debt rescheduling),Angola,"http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020041005e0a50003y&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, Recipient media or official; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020050517e15h0004j&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, International media report; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020050805e185000uo&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, Recipient media or official; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020050901e19100038&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, International media report; http://www.macauhub.com.mo/en/2006/06/27/1253/, Other English Source, Donor media or official; http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/19/magazine/19china.html?pagewanted=all&_moc.semityn.www, Google US, International media report; http://www.crbc.com/newsInfo.asp?NID=384, Local Language Source, Donor media or official; http://www.ide.go.jp/English/Data/Africa_file/Manualreport/cia_11.html, Google US, Non-media; http://www.macauhub.com.mo/en/2009/09/10/7749/, Google US, Donor media or official; http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/article/new-imperialism-china-angola, Google US, Non-media",10,"Export-Import Bank of China, Government Agency","Benguela Railway Company, State-Owned Company; China International Fund (CIF), Private Sector; China Railway 20 Bureau Group Co., Ltd., State-Owned Company; China Road & Bridge Corporation (CRBC), State-Owned Company","China International Fund (CIF), Private Sector; China Railway 20 Bureau Group Co., Ltd., State-Owned Company; China Road & Bridge Corporation (CRBC), State-Owned Company; Export-Import Bank of China, Government Agency",4,"Africon Gabenk BKS; Benguela Railway Company, State-Owned Company",2,Checked,1,Vague (Official Finance),5,Unset,,Active,1,"http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020041005e0a50003y&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, Recipient media or official; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020050517e15h0004j&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, International media report; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020050805e185000uo&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, Recipient media or official; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020050901e19100038&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, International media report; http://www.macauhub.com.mo/en/2006/06/27/1253/, Factiva, Donor media or official; http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/19/magazine/19china.html?pagewanted=all&_moc.semityn.www, Factiva, International media report; http://www.crbc.com/newsInfo.asp?NID=384, Factiva, Donor media or official; http://www.ide.go.jp/English/Data/Africa_file/Manualreport/cia_11.html, Factiva, Non-media; http://www.macauhub.com.mo/en/2009/09/10/7749/, Factiva, Donor media or official; http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/article/new-imperialism-china-angola, Factiva, Non-media",2000000000,USD,0.69665105,1,2870877753,,1-Dec-05,,,1,Angola,540,225,Angola,AGO,AO,24,614,Not Commercial,2,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,

The fiber optic network will cover the whole country providing more durable and efficient common bandwidth for all communication service providers. Under the project, all regional capitals and 36 major towns would be linked by fiber optics to enhance rural telephone and internet services. The fiber optics will be linked with Kumasi and further to the north, subsequently connecting Accra. The first phase of the project, upgrading the existing fiber optic network and expanding the communications network in the southern loop, is expected to be completed in January of 2008, and the second phase, the expansion of the network to parts of northern Ghana, is expected to be completed by the end of 2008. Ghanaian Minister of Communications Albert Kan Dapaah and VP of China's Eximbank met to agree on the deal. Deputy Minister of Communication in Ghana Dr. Benjamin Aggrey Ntim was also familiar with the project. According to reports, the construction of the project started in 2006 by Chinese company Huawei Technologies, while Eximbank made available $31 million USD towards the project. The project was initiated by the Ministry of Communications at a cost of $70 million USD. As of 2011, the project was still under construction. The project was untied.

The loan was granted by the Export-Import Bank of China, but the trains and locomotives have already been purchased, and TransNamib will deliver the first four machines for $12 million USD each. From a report in 2008, it appears that TransNamib ultimately purchased 17 red Chinese-made locomotives in addition to the four blue ones originally purchased. However, these purchases appear to be a strain on the company because of chronic mechanical problems. The project is likely tied with mineral resources, especially uranium.

Ghanaian Minister of Communications Albert Kan Dapaah, Chinese ambassador to Ghana Lu Yonjshou, CEO of GT Oystein Bjorge, and Chairman of Alcatel Shanghai Bell Yuan Xin are all familiar with the project. In December 2003, the project was suspended because of a lawsuit against GT by Malaysian G-Gom. According to reports in 2005, the project was continued with the installation of 250 radio antenna to serve about 400,000 mobile phone users. 60 Chinese engineers are participating in the project. It is still unclear if the project was completed, but it appears to be untied. There appears to be some discrepancy between the amounts, reports include $67 million USD and $79 million USD, but it is unclear exactly how the money was designated.Phase 1 of the project appears to have been completed with the help of 60 Chinese engineers. Sources confirmed that Phase 2 was beginning in 2005.(PPIAF) In 2005, Ghana Telecom signed a buyer credit agreement with Societe Generale Corporate and Investment Bank (SG CIB) worth $67 million USD. The agreement carries a maturity of 6 years. Funds will be used to upgrade and expand Ghana Telecom's networks, financing the import of equipment from Alcatel Shanghai Bell. The loan is insured by Sinosure, the Chinese export credit agency. Phase 2 of Ghana telecom project includes the supply of fixed network exchanges, mobile network equipment, and optical transfer equipment. Sinosure prevented default on this deal, after receiving preliminary notice of potential default in February 2007. There is some confusion that this might be a 50-50 Chinese-French joint venture. The total cost for Phase 2 appears to be $80 million USD, and the Chinese will commit $67 million USD.

187,China,Souapiti Dam project on the Konkouri River,2006,FALSE,"In 2007, after an original agreement in 2006 with China's Exim Bank, the Chinese government is reported to have pledged funding of US$850m towards the building of the Souapiti hydroelectric dam on the Konkouré River in the north of the country. Lack of funding has stalled the project—whose total cost is put at US$1bn—for many years. Attempts were initially made to link the project to various proposals for building alumina refineries, but the relevant investors could not be persuaded to help finance the construction of the dam. The proposed Souapiti station would potentially generate 515 mW of electricity and would have the potential to supply not only the capital but also many industrial projects, such as the alumina refineries, as well as areas outside Conakry. The US$850m financing is being organized through China's Exim Bank, and a Chinese state-owned construction company, Sinohydro, is to build the dam.

211,China,"License for 17,0 Manganese Mines",2006,FALSE,"In 2006, the private company, Huazhou Mines Investment Co. Ltd won the license for the 11520 square kilometer Njielei Manganese Mines with the support of Gabon's Minsistry of Mining. The license came after a year of mining exploration. In 2007, CITIC Dameng Mining was approached by the Ningbo Huazhou group and formed a strategic cooperation with Ningbo Huazhou Mining Investment Co. Limited in Gabon. It was agreed that CITIC Dameng Mining and Ningbo Huazhou Mining should jointly pursue and invest in potential mining activities in Gabon, taking advantage of the exploration and mining interest held by Ningbo Huazhou Mining through its subsidiary CICMHZ. It is unclear whether CITIC Dameng is involved in this project. This appears to be the same project as listed here: 'Deposits Ndjolé will be operated by the Chinese group, who presented the Minister of Mines, feasibility studies conducted since 2006. Four years later, the Chinese can now move to the operational phase of the exploitation of this mineral, located at Bembele Mountains about 36 km from the city of Ndolé and 200 km from Libreville. Its reserves are estimated at 30 million tonnes grading an average of 40%. To ensure service quality, the Chinese operator plans to invest 17 billion FCFA. So that in its second year, the company will produce one million tons of manganese a year. And it plans to hire 300 Gabonese the mine site, with the key building hospitals, schools and strengthening existing structures.'This paragraph may also be relevant: Manganese production at the M’bembélé mine, located at Ndjolé, which officially went into operation in the second quarter 2011, is expected to reach 500,000 tonnes per annum. The commissioning of the site was accompanied by the building of an electrical power station and 225 km of railways to connect and supply the site with power. This project is a problem project mainly because Huazhou is involved in several mining ventures in Gabon in different areas, and it is often unclear which site is being referred to by news articles. The first step in better assuring the quality of this information should perhaps come from determining the relationship between the Nijelei mines, the M’bembélé mines and the Ndjole mines.

630,China,CMEC iron infrastructure in Belinga,2005,FALSE,"On April 21, 2005 China National Machinery and Equipment Import/Export Company (CMEC) announced plans to manage an infrastructural investment in Belinga. The investment would include the construction of 200 km of railway, a new deep water port and a hydroelectric dam, at a cost of around 300 billion CFA franc (US$600 million). Original plans stated that the project would begin in 2008. In 2007 or 2008 (depending on sources), CMEC signed an official 25-year agreement with the Gabonese government to carry out the project. Controversially, the agreement between CMEC and the government guaranteed that China would benefit from 90 per cent of the wealth that the mine generated. The project was delayed, partially by protests from a nonprofit group called Brainforest concerned about the environmental impact of the dam. CMEC agreed to begin the mining project by 2011, but did not begin the project on time. On February 4, 2012 Gabon and mining firm BHP Billiton reached a deal that BHP would carry out the project, and the contract was taken from CMEC. STAFF_NOTES: There is some discrepancy over the financial and other quantitative figures. According to Xinhua News, the agreement signed between CMEC and Gabon includes 560 km long railway, a deep water port 25 km from Libreville, and other ancillary works, including the construction and maintenance of power plants. The project is expected to take three years and the total cost is about USD$3,000,000,000. The cost will be covered by sales revenue generated from the iron ore. At its peak, it is expected that the project will generate 25,000 jobs for Gabon.

Since operating permits are only granted to companies incorporated under Gabonese law, the Chinese entities interested in manganese in Ndjolé merged to form a Gabonese company under the name of C.I.C.M.G. (Compagnie industrielle et commerciale des mines du Gabon). The joint venture company - known as the Industrial and Commercial Mines Company of Gabon (CICMG) - will invest some 1.275 billion CFA francs (US$2.4 million) in exploration activities, ahead of a decision in February 2006 on whether or not to exploit the deposits.

The project came in response to Kenya's substantial housing deficit. On December 6, 2006, China Development Bank announced that it would provide a 10 million dollar concessionary loan for the housing project, to be repaid in 15 years. The Development Bank of Kenya plans to provide long-term finance of up to 15 years to low and middle income housing project customers. On May 30, 2008 the ground-breaking ceremony of the housing project occurred. The entire project is expected to last about fifteen years (until 2021) or later, but may last longer due to slow progress accredited to court injuctions and land scarcity. As of 2012, only 2,000 housing units have been completed comared to the 40,000 planned for completion.Implementation of the project's first phase involves the production of 720 housing units for sale and appears to have been successfully completed. As of January 2011, the implementing agencies have concentrated their efforts on Phases 2 and 3. The implementation of the project has so far been carried out by implementing agencies China Wu Yi Corporation Limited and Ederman Properties. Construction efforts in the 'Greatwall Apartments' Complex have successfully provided Kenyan citizens with 528 apartments, as well as facilities including shops and school. Another 105 houses have been constructed as part of the Kileleshwa Park Apartments. Further construction efforts include building 700 housing units in Ngara. 1,000 units in Kibera, 700 units in Madaraka and Nairobi West and 105 units in Lang'ata. The project is linked to the Development Financial Cooperation Framework Agreement (DFCFA) signed by the Kenyan government and the China Development Bank in December 2008. As per the DFCFA, the project will operate in accordance with market principles rather than traditional aid.Funding for the package came as part of a 20 million USD credit for housing, education and health care from the China Development Bank.Contacts who have publicly commented on the project include Chinese Ambassador to Kenya Zhang Ming, general director of the Africa Project Development Team Zhu Qingdong, managing director of the Erdemann Property Limited Yang Zeyun and Housing minister Soita Shitanda.

1043,China, KPLC Power generation expansion (may overlap with Olkaria geothermal project),2005,FALSE,"On September 1, 2005 managing director of Kenya Power and Lighting Co. Ltd (KPLC) Jasper Oduorto and Kenyan Energy Minister Kiraitu Murungi announced that funding had been secured for Phase 1 of a project to expand Kenyan energy capacity and access to energy. Under the project, the state-owned KPLC would connect 150,000 new power consumers every year. Phase 1 of the project includes plans to establish a 61 km long 132kV line from Chemosit to Kisii, where a sub-station will be constructed, as well as the construction of several power distribution lines. Media sources indicate that China provided a 25 million USD soft loan for Phase 1 and could potentially provide another 35 million USD loan for Phase 2. Later KPLC reports indicate that Phase 1 was financed by 'about 20 million USD' concessional loan from the Exim Bank, and that it began implementation. Phase 2, which may or may not have secured funding, involves construction of a 220kV transmission line from Olkaria geothermal power station near Naivasha to Lessos sub-station. Also proposed under this phase is the establishment of a 132kV transmission line from Rabai sub-station to the tourism hub of the South Coast (note: discrepancy, as another source says a 122-km long, 132kV line will go from Kamburu hydropower substation to Meru). This appears to be connected to project #606, the Olkaria II Geothermal Project. As part of the agreement to fund the project, KPLC agreed to procure materials and equipment from Chinese companies. Reports show that China CAMC exchanged information with KPLC, but do not show whether the China CAMC was involved in the implementation of the project. The extent to which Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the project have been completed is also unknown.

The total project cost of 650 million MUR was discussed in the Cabinet, however this was greater than the Chinese commitment. In January of 2005, acting foreign affairs minister Arianne Navarre-Marie signed an interest-free loan agreement for 150 million MUR that will be refundable after a 10-year period beginning 2015.

On January 19th of 2006, Minister of Finance Rama Sithanen signed an Economic and Technical Cooperation agreement with Chinese ambassador Xu Menghsui (as reported) for an interest-free loan of 70 million MUR. At the time, it was slated for projects to be determined. Part of the 70 million MUR loan was used for the headquarters, while part was used to finance radio and TV broadcasting equipment for the company. Finally, in August of 2006, the Chinese government provided an interest-free loan of 100 million CNY for the design, construction, and engineering of the new Mauritius Broadcasting Corp.'s headquarters. This involved the provision of technical assistance. The International Engineering Department of Beijing Construction Engineering Group Co., Ltd. (BCEG) began construction in March of 2008.

Referred to as the Lesotho Highlands Power Project, the power would come from 6 gW of wind energy and 4 gW of pumped-storage hydro power. The project cost is estimated at 110 billion ZAR, and it was stated that most of the finance would come from in the form of loans from unnamed Chinese firms, while the equity for the project would come from Breeze Power, a joint venture between the Lesotho government and South Africa's Harrison and White Investments (HWI). Construction on the first phase is slated to begin in 2012 with the first 150 mW wind farm. 600 mW of the wind capacity is supposed to be online by 2016. As part of this project, manufacturing facilities will be built in Lesotho and South Africa. Later, Ming Yang Wind Power was confirmed as a major supplier of turbines for this project. Two new contracts were signed with Mops Civil for the construction of a 3.8 km access road and with South African BKS for the construction of the measuring weir river barrier. The road was completed in November 2011 while the weir was still under construction and expected to be completed by September 2012. The timeline for this project is as follows: environmental and social baseline studies between August 2012-July 2020, construction tenders from November 2012-January 2015, construction of advance infrastructure from July 2014-December 2015, construction of the Polihali dam and tunnel to start in January 2016 and end in March 2020, a pump storage feasibility study to be completed in August 2012 with provisional construction to run from January 2013-December 2017, and impounding a reservoir to 2,000 meters above sea level to finish in August 2018, with the first water being delivered to South Africa in August 2020.

1866,China,Shenzhen Energy thermal energy power plant in Ghana,2007,FALSE,"(PPIAF) In 2007, China's Shenzhen Energy Investment Co. Ltd. planned to team up with an Africa development fund set up by the Chinese government to build a 200 mW gas-fired power plant in Ghana. The firm plans to form a venture in Ghana with the China-Africa Development Fund to develop the project, estimated at $137.2 million USD. The project would be installed with two generators currently used at power plants owned by the listed firm and its parent. The 200 mW power plant will be the first phase of a 560 mW project planned in Ghana. In April of 2008, Ghanaian president John Kufuor took part in the ground breaking ceremony at the power station at Kpone near Tema. There is some debate over the actual value of the project; it is possible that the project is actually worth $143 million USD. The project will be conducted by Sunon Asogli Power, the joint venture between Shenzhen (60%) and the Development Fund (40%). The project created controversy when Volta Aluminum Company (VALCO), which owned an idle plot of land 300metres away from the land sold to Sunon Asogli Power, built several metres of solid block wall to stop Sunon Asogli Power from gaining access to the construction site. (Shenzen had already spent $50million to prepare the site). Activists protested that VALCO did not have a rightful claim to the idle land, since it was bought from the government in 1952 through compulsory acquisition which forcibly displaced local people. With the vocal support of these local activists, the first phase of the gas project was completed in April 2009. Later, the capacity will be increased to 560 MW. The first phase was completed within 15 months [started August of 2007]. The majority of the engineers, consultants and managers of the project will be Chinese, but it will employ 1,000 Ghanaians. It appears that further construction may have increased the value of the project to $600 million USD in 2009, and in 2012 the partners planned to invest an additional $300 million USD. but it appears that the second phase of the project is still being implemented.

The Kpong Water Supply Extension Project covers a planning calendar that extends to 2015 and includes enhancement of transmission lines to increase water supply by an additional 40 million gallons a day. Checks by the Daily Graphic from the Ghana Water Company [GWCL] indicated that work had already begun on the assessment, which should be taken between three and six months to complete. The construction of a new intake and water pumping station for bulk water supply from Kpong with capacity of 196,000 cubic metres per day will form the first phase, with the second phase covering the construction of a new treatment plant of 186,000 cubic metres or 41 million gallons a day. The third phase consists of a new treated water pumping station as well as a pressure transmission (mains) system from Kpong to Accra through Oyibi to terminate at Okponglo [suburb of Accra] out in the five-year plan. (PPIAF) In 2010, the Chinese government agreed to provide Ghana with preferential buyer's credit worth $260 million USD for the execution of the Kpong Water Expansion Supply Project to help boost water delivery systems in the country. The facility has a grace period of five years, repayment duration of 15 years, maturity period of 20 years, interest rate of 2 percent per annum, a commitment fee of 0.75 percent per annum, a management fee of 1 percent flat, and a grant element of 37.08 percent.

18800,China,Zimbabwe acquires Chinese agricultural support facility,2006,FALSE,"On September 14, 2006, the governments of Zimbabwe and China signed a US$200 million loan agreement to be used for agricultural support and the planned importation of 387,000 tons of Chinese fertilizer for needy Zimbabwean farmers. Agricultural uses for the US$200 million loan include the payment of agricultural equipment, chemicals, and other critical requirements. The shipment of fertilizer is expected to arrive in Zimbabwe at the beginning of October 2006 to help farmers deal with crop shortages. The loan is being facilitated by both the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe and the Export-Import Bank of China. The Zimbabwean government was represented by Gideon Gono, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, while the fertilizer agreement is a result of a visit to China made by the Vice President of Zimbabwe, Joice Mujuru, and the Zimbabwe Secretary of Economic Development, A. Bvumbe.The first consignment of fertilizer from China arrived into Zimbabwe by December 26, 2012, although the amount of fertilizer was not specified. The fertilizer in question was of Compound Types D, S, C, and L. On February 1, 2007, Samuel Muvuti, acting chief executive of the state-owned Zimbabwe Grain Marketing Board, announced that a second shipment of 13,000 tonnes of fertilizer procured through the US$200 million loan was delivered to Zimbabwe via Mozambique from China with 8,000 tonnes still in transit and 14,000 tonnes awaiting transportation at port in Mozambique with the goal of delivering the fertilizer from the port by mid-February 2007. As of this date, only 57,000 tonnes of the agreed 387,000 had arrived in the country.In 2006, the government of Zimbabwe agreed to mortgage the loan from China using platinum mining concessions from the Selous and Northfields Mines. The mining transactions were to occur through the Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation (ZMDC) and Chinese mining firm Wanbao Mining. However, in a different US$200 million deal with Eximbank, also in 2006, these same mining areas were also up for collateral, causing both deals to stall. On July 11, 2009, Minister Biti signed another memorandum of understanding with the Chinese company Wanbao to free up the mining concessions in Selous and Northfields and allow Wanbao to being mining after the clarification and finalization of legal documentation between the Chinese and the Zimbabwean governments. The terms of the agreement include: the value of the commercial contract should be more than US$2 million.The portion of the Chinese content of exported goods should be no less than 50% of the total value. The cash payment (down payment) made by the importer to the Chinese exporter should not be less than 15% of the total contract value or 20% in the case of ship export contract. The export buyer's credit provided by the Eximbank of China for an export project of goods or services shall not exceed 85% of the total contract value, and 80% in the case of a ship export contract. Additional research into the completion date of the fertilizer delivery was unsuccessful. In 2007, a consignment of 1,000 more tractors and an assortment of other related farming implements worth $100 million USD from China was expected to arrive. The implements include harvesters, irrigation pumps, disc harrows, planters, and electricity generators. As of November of 2011, the facilities were being shipped from China to Zimbabwe. These goods compose the remaining value of the $200 million USD Chinese government loan.It appears that Zimbabwe may have purchased 97 trucks as part of the deal (ID#19874), but no financial value for the project was given.However, as of July 2012, it does appear that Zimbabwe defaulted on its repayment of the $200 million USD loan.This project is related to ID#19807 and ID#19874.","Agriculture, Fishing and Forestry",,310,Implementation,2,Loan (excluding debt rescheduling),Zimbabwe,"http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020060913e29d001ib&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, International media report; http://www.rbz.co.zw/pdfs/ps_ForexFacilities.pdf, Google US, Non-media; http://rawstory.com/news/2006/Zimbabwe_secures_loans_of_490_milli_09142006.html, Google US, International media report; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020060928e29s00039&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, International media report; http://global.factiva.com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020071102e3b20008f&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, Recipient media or official; http://global.factiva.com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020080103e413000ei&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, Recipient media or official; http://zimbabwenewsonline.com/top_news/117.html, Google US, Recipient media or official; http://allafrica.com/stories/200612140090.html, Google US, Recipient media or official; http://www.newzimbabwe.com/news-8340-Zimbabwe%2525252520defaults%2525252520on%2525252520$200m%2525252520China%2525252520loan/news.aspx, Google US, Recipient media or official; http://www.zfhz.org/english/newsdis.asp?id=662&stype=24&type=4, Google US, Recipient media or official",10,"Export-Import Bank of China, Government Agency",,"Export-Import Bank of China, Government Agency",1,"Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), State-Owned Company; Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation (ZMDC), State-Owned Company",2,Checked,1,OOF-like,3,Development,,Active,1,"http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020060913e29d001ib&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, International media report; http://www.rbz.co.zw/pdfs/ps_ForexFacilities.pdf, Factiva, Non-media; http://rawstory.com/news/2006/Zimbabwe_secures_loans_of_490_milli_09142006.html, Factiva, International media report; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020060928e29s00039&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, International media report; http://global.factiva.com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020071102e3b20008f&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, Recipient media or official; http://global.factiva.com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020080103e413000ei&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, Recipient media or official; http://zimbabwenewsonline.com/top_news/117.html, Factiva, Recipient media or official; http://allafrica.com/stories/200612140090.html, Factiva, Recipient media or official; http://www.newzimbabwe.com/news-8340-Zimbabwe%2525252520defaults%2525252520on%2525252520$200m%2525252520China%2525252520loan/news.aspx, Factiva, Recipient media or official; http://www.zfhz.org/english/newsdis.asp?id=662&stype=24&type=4, Factiva, Recipient media or official",200000000,USD,0.743052144,1,269160114.3,1-Feb-07,1-Oct-06,,,1,Zimbabwe,552,265,Zimbabwe,ZWE,ZW,716,698,Not Commercial,2,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,

20104,China,Second Interest-free Loan for MBC Headquarters,2004,FALSE,"On June 8th, 2001, the Mauritian Cabinet agreed to the signing of an interest-free loan agreement of 20 million CNY for project financing, with projects to be decided by both sides. Then, in 2004, the Cabinet held a Working Session with a Chinese delegation, resulting in a new interest-free loan agreement of 20 million CNY and the decision to use these loan funds for the construction of a new headquarters for the Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation at Ebène. The Beijing Construction Engineering Co. Ltd. agreed to implement the project. The total project cost of 650 million MUR was discussed in the Cabinet, however this was greater than the Chinese commitment. In January of 2005, acting foreign affairs minister Arianne Navarre-Marie signed an interest-free loan agreement for 150 million MUR that will be refundable after a 10-year period beginning 2015. It was reported at the time that this loan would partly be used for the construction of a new radio and television station. On January 19th of 2006, Minister of Finance Rama Sithanen signed an Economic and Technical Cooperation agreement with Chinese ambassador Xu Menghsui (as reported) for an interest-free loan of 70 million MUR. At the time, it was slated for projects to be determined. Part of the 70 million MUR loan was used for the headquarters, while part was used to finance radio and TV broadcasting equipment for the company. Finally, in August of 2006, the Chinese government provided an interest-free loan of 100 million CNY for the design, construction, and engineering of the new Mauritius Broadcasting Corp.'s headquarters. This involved the provision of technical assistance. The International Engineering Department of Beijing Construction Engineering Group Co., Ltd. (BCEG) began construction in March of 2008.

The Beijing Construction Engineering Co. Ltd. agreed to implement the project. The total project cost of 650 million MUR was discussed in the Cabinet, however this was greater than the Chinese commitment. In January of 2005, acting foreign affairs minister Arianne Navarre-Marie signed an interest-free loan agreement for 150 million MUR that will be refundable after a 10-year period beginning 2015.

On January 19th of 2006, Minister of Finance Rama Sithanen signed an Economic and Technical Cooperation agreement with Chinese ambassador Xu Menghsui (as reported) for an interest-free loan of 70 million MUR. At the time, it was slated for projects to be determined. Part of the 70 million MUR loan was used for the headquarters, while part was used to finance radio and TV broadcasting equipment for the company. Finally, in August of 2006, the Chinese government provided an interest-free loan of 100 million CNY for the design, construction, and engineering of the new Mauritius Broadcasting Corp.'s headquarters. This involved the provision of technical assistance. The International Engineering Department of Beijing Construction Engineering Group Co., Ltd. (BCEG) began construction in March of 2008.

Another Chinese company, Anjin, and Pure Diamonds, were also given concessions in the Chiadzwa diamond fields. Anjin is a joint venture between the Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation (10%), the Zimbabwe Defense Industries, or ZDI, (40%) and Chinese investors (50%). There is some discrepancy as to the 10% ownership. Sources suggest that the 10% is actually owned by a company called Matt Bronze, which is controlled by the Zimbabwean army. The remaining companies include Mbada Diamonds and Marange Mineral Resources. As of 2011, Anjin had produced 1 million carats of rough diamonds, subsequently awaiting the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme to start exporting. There appeared to be some human rights groups that strongly opposed the methods of extraction. Anjin alone had invested over $310 million USD in its mine and development of infrastructure in the area where families were relocated. More than 400 four bedroom homes, blair toilets, and thatched huts have been built. In addition, the company has also built a clinic, a primary school, and a secondary school. In December of 2011, the diamonds were expected to be put on sale. The mine generated controversy when 20,000 small-scale miners invaded the area in 2008 and were forcibly removed by soldiers and police. Up to 200 people were killed during the event.

23895,China,Zimbabwe signs agreement to free mortgaged Chinese platinum mining concessions,2006,FALSE,"On July 11, 2009, the government of Zimbabwe signed a US$200 million memorandum of understanding with the Export-Import Bank of China. Biti signed an MoU with Eximbank to free the platinum concession which was mortgaged in 2006 when Zimbabwe signed a US$200 million facility with the bank. The deal dates back to events starting in 2006. It involved the Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation (ZMDC) and a Chinese company, Wanbao Mining, for the development of platinum in a concession known as Selous and Northfields reserves covering 110 square kilometres. ZMDC represented the Zimbabwean government and Wanbao the Chinese. However, when Zimbabwe in 2006 negotiated a US$200 million facility with Eximbank, the Selous and Northfields reserves were put up as collateral. This left the concession encumbered and the mining deal was stalled for a while. Biti has now signed the MoU to extricate the concession and allow for the mining upon finalisation of 'legal documentation and declaration of the obligations of the Chinese'. The Chinese development assistance has been in the form of concessional loans, export credit (including buyer's and seller's credit) and grants. Zimbabwe has benefited from a buyer's credit loan from China.

25227,China,ZESA and CATIC sign a cooperation agreement,2004,FALSE,"On November 4, 2004, the Zimbabwe state-owned electricity utility ZESA Holdings Limited signed a cooperation agreement with Chinese state-owned company CATIC (National Aero-Technology Import and Export Corporation) worth US$2.4 billion; the agreement was comprised of a series of smaller deals.The largest of these projects was a US$386 million agreement was signed between the Zimbabwean national electric utility, Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA), and its subsidiary, the Zimbabwe Power Company, and the state-owned Chinese company China National Aero Technology Import and Export Corporation for the construction of two 300 mW electricity generation units, Units 7 and 8, at the Hwange Power Station worth US$368 million. According to a Zimbabwean government document, the Zimbabwean government and ZESA will secure the loan with contract-farmed tobacco exports to China as well as giving CATIC a 70% share in the Hwange Power Station. At the signing agreement were the visiting chairman of the Chinese National People's Congress Standing Committee, Wu Bangguo; the vice-president of CATIC, Wang Dawei; and the chairman of ZESA holdings, Dr. Sydney Gata. Construction on the project was expected to commence in January 2005. However, June 2005 report stated that CATIC would not honor its pledge to invest with ZESA to upgrade the Hwange Power Station with two units of 300 mW each unless it was guaranteed coal concessions in return by the government of Zimbabwe, and that construction on the project was 18 months behind schedule at the time. Additionally, a March 2012 Zimbabwean media report indicated that the Zimbabwean government was taking new bids for this same project to expand Hwange Power Station (including the same specifications) from a number of new companies suggesting that probably cancellation of CATIC's deal with ZESA from 2004. The project has been suspended until a new firm can be established.The next largest portion of the agreement was a US$143 million financing agreement between the CATIC and ZESA for the development of a domestic capacity to manufacture electricity distribution equipment. The Chinese delegation was led by the Visiting Chairman of the Chinese National People's Congress Standing Committee, Wu Bangguo, while the recipient company ZESA was represented by the company chairman, Dr. Sydney Gata. Additional research into project implementation updates was unsuccessful.The smallest announced portion of the agreement was a deal the Chinese government signed with ZESA worth US$40 million for the domestic manufacture of electrical transmission equipment. ZESA was represented by its company chairman Dr. Sydney Gata. Additional research into project implementation updates was unsuccessful.The remaining funds have been distributed among a series of projects, including a rural electrification project. It is unclear exactly how the remaining funds were used.It is noted that this project was signed at the same time as Project ID#17149, but there is no indication that the expansion of Kariba-South falls under the same overarching agreement.An additional source:http://www.google.com/url?sa=t rct=j q= esrc=s source=web cd=1 cad=rja ved=0CCUQFjAA url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.siis.org.cn%2FSh_Yj_Cms%2FMgz%2F201202%2F2012711142130JPQ5.DOC ei=qaZkUO6XM6Tz0gGj24HIBg usg=AFQjCNEIbQnvlaqWY0Lsdo2sdKBJPgeZwg","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining",,230,Pipeline: Commitment,11,Foreign direct investment,Zimbabwe,"http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020041014e0ae000xi&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, Recipient media or official; http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/iez/50063.pdf, Google US, Non-media; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LQAF000020041106e0b40000f&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, International media report; http://www.zimbabwesituation.com/nov9_2004.html#link11, Google US, Recipient media or official; http://global.factiva.com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=AMIN000020050713e1680006j&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, International media report; http://allafrica.com/stories/201203170256.html, Google US, Recipient media or official; https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:7c3JROSBhrgJ:www.rbz.co.zw/inc/publications/legaldept/rbzpdfs/Supplement4.pdf+&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESgWm4c1GM57OK5gu00QG4yAjAL_1v, Google US, Non-media; http://www.cccme.org.cn/cn/news/details.asp?id=21745; PPIAF_Source",9,,"China National Aero-Technology Import & Export Corporation (CATIC), State-Owned Company; Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA), State-Owned Company; Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC), State-Owned Company","China National Aero-Technology Import & Export Corporation (CATIC), State-Owned Company",1,"Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA), State-Owned Company; Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC), State-Owned Company",2,Checked,1,FDI +Gov,9,Commercial,,Active,1,"http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020041014e0ae000xi&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, Recipient media or official; http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/iez/50063.pdf, Factiva, Non-media; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LQAF000020041106e0b40000f&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, International media report; http://www.zimbabwesituation.com/nov9_2004.html#link11, Factiva, Recipient media or official; http://global.factiva.com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=AMIN000020050713e1680006j&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, International media report; http://allafrica.com/stories/201203170256.html, Factiva, Recipient media or official; https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:7c3JROSBhrgJ:www.rbz.co.zw/inc/publications/legaldept/rbzpdfs/Supplement4.pdf+&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESgWm4c1GM57OK5gu00QG4yAjAL_1v, Factiva, Non-media; http://www.cccme.org.cn/cn/news/details.asp?id=21745, Factiva; PPIAF_Source, Factiva",2400000000,USD,0.663629447,1,3616476049,,1-Jan-05,,,1,Zimbabwe,552,265,Zimbabwe,ZWE,ZW,716,698,Commercial,1,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,

The loan for the mechanization program is to be facilitated by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe on behalf of Farmers' World. The loan agreement was attended by the Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce, Gao Hucheng, and the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gideon Gono. The delivery of the second phase of the project was completed on May 17, 2009 with the delivery of 384 tractors, 300 disc harrows, 300 ploughs, more than 100 generators, excavators, front-end loaders, 300 reapers, 30-ton trucks, 10-tonne trucks, 30 combine harvesters, electric irrigation motors, irrigation sprinklers and pipes. The recipient farmers were expected to cover 20% of the coast of the farming equipment they received. The Zimbabwean government, through the Zimbabwe Farmers' Development Trust, intends to repay the loan from the Chinese company through the delivery of 30,000,000 kilograms of tobacco for four straight years to China followed by an increase to 80,000,000 kilograms in the fifth year.

Projects to be included under the loan include: the Western Corridor Gas Commercialization project, the establishment of gas-processing plant at Bonyere to use gas discoveries from Jubilee and Sankofa fields for power generation, the construction of gas transmission pipelines from Bonyere to Western region, an industrial minerals processing estate, developing mineral processing industries in the Export Processing Zone in Sekondi, railway line expansions, among others.
